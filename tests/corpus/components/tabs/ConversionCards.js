// output) and a "DSD Sources" subsection (how a DSD/SDM source is handled) —
// with a mode-mismatch note at the top when the current output mode doesn't
// use the card.
//
// The DSD Sources half is collapsible and starts shut: most libraries are
// entirely PCM, so its three controls are dead weight for most users. The narrow

// Either way the number is volatile across engine versions (architecture §2), so
// match on the option's name and never on the number.
