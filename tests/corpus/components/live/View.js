// The LIVE page — one page of only the settings the engine can change right now,
// each written the moment it is changed. No staging, no Apply, and no control on
// it is ever refused because playback is running: what a live change costs
// mid-stream is the user's to spend, so the lede names the cost and the click
// does the thing (CLAUDE.md).
//
// That lede is the page's one piece of its own prose, and it is page-wide on
// purpose: every control here writes the same way and lasts the same length of
// time, so saying it once at the top beats repeating a variant of it under each
// control. Everything else a control says comes from the catalog the tabs read
// (store/prose.js) — same knob, same words.
//
// The controls are hand-rolled rather than `Field`s on purpose. A Field is bound
// to the staged/dirty/Apply model — effective(), edit(), the dirty highlight —
// and none of that exists here: the value a LIVE control shows is what the engine
// reported back after the write, and its only state is "writing" or "this is why
// it was refused".
