// The frequency pane: linear frequency from 0 to the larger of twice the
// source rate and the output rate, the source music as a wash below source
// Nyquist, its images mirrored above, the filter magnitude as the accent
// trace, and the output stream as a fill: above source Nyquist it is the leak,
// and when downsampling what folds into the passband. No oversampling draws no
// filter and no leak: the output is the source's own curve, and a fill painted
// over the wash and its images at one opacity would flatten the two into one
// slab.
//
// Every curve is drawn through `peakColumns`, one column per pixel the page
// reports and the column's peak within it, so a comb finer than the window can
// hold reads as its own envelope instead of beating against the pixel grid;
// the store's grid is dense enough for the peak to be one (math section 5.4).
// The dB scale carries headroom above 0 so a passband overshoot draws as the
// overshoot it is rather than as a flat run along the top of the plot, and the
// Nyquist marks are drawn over the fills so a reference line stays a line.
