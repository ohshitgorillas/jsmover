// The impulse pane: the transient as a ghost trace, the filtered output as the
// accent trace, milliseconds either side of the transient. The frame comes
// from the state, never from the drawing: the axis spans the filter's length
// as the Length control states it, unrounded, so a filter of a given length
// always fills the frame and a drag rescales the axis smoothly instead of
// jumping at each round figure. The tick step rounds; the span does not. Where
// the transient is wider than the filter the frame widens to hold it, the
// input being a reference a reader compares against and a cut reference being
// worse than a wide frame. Time zero is the input's centre after the filter's
// nominal delay (store `output`); linear phase is symmetric about it, minimum
// phase runs the filter to the right of it and holds only the input's own half
// extent to the left. Amplitude is fixed to unit input with headroom, so the
// pane is comparable across states and a real level drop reads as one; a peak
// past the headroom is clipped to the plot rectangle rather than drawn over
// the pane's top band. The output is drawn through `traceColumns`, one rule
// per column and one column per rendered pixel, so the trace resolves to the
// window it is drawn in rather than to the viewBox, and a resize redraws it at
// the new resolution instead of scaling the old points; where the ring at the
// cutoff runs faster than the columns can draw a wave, the output is a band of
// each column's excursion instead (`bandColumns`), the envelope a hash would
// hide; the input is the source's own
// samples, one vertex each, in the dashed muted ghost every other plot uses,
// drawn over the output so the reference stays readable where the two
// coincide. The left gutter carries an amplitude axis whose ticks are fixed to
// unit input rather than to what is drawn, so a peak below one reads as the
// level drop it is instead of filling the frame, and each trace carries its own
// name in the plot's top corner. Where the design is the identity the output is
// the input's own array and one name is drawn, not two on the same pixels.
