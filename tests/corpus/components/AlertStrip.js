// Engine-health alert strip — a warning row under the signal-path bar that
// exists only while something is wrong (healthy = zero pixels, matching the
// bar's omit-disabled-stages principle). Conditions and wording live in
// store/health.js; this just renders the list.
//
// The junk-filter advice chip (store/alerts/junkadvice.js) rides the same strip: it is
// the same "the engine has something to tell you" surface, but advisory rather
// than a fault, so it carries its own tone. Text only — no controls; it clears
// itself when the track changes or the engaged settings treat the junk.
// Rate/shaper conflicts (store/alerts/shaperfit.js) ride the strip between the two:
// they are faults like the health alerts rather than advice, but they are a
// property of the settings rather than of playback, so unlike the health alerts
// they show with the engine stopped.
// The rejected-credentials row (store/alerts/credentials.js) leads the strip: a
// refused credential explains the whole broken half of the app, so it outranks a
// per-track health warning.
