// The far-ear path is not a straight line to the far ear: sound grazes the head
// and wraps around it to the shadowed side, and that wrap IS the interaural
// delay the structural model encodes (docs/crossfeed-math.md). Drawing it
// straight sent it through the head, where the filled head disc painted over it
// — so the dashed line appeared to stop at the listener's nose instead of
// reaching an ear.
//
// So: straight from the speaker to a tangent point, then round the head to the
// far ear. earDeg is the far ear's position on the head circle (0 = right,
// 180 = left); the path passes the front, which is the shorter way round for
// every angle the control allows.
//
// The arc is struck on a circle STANDOFF px outside the head rather than on the
// head itself. Riding the skull read as the line wrapping the listener's face —
// and the nose, which projects 4px, punched straight through it. The standoff
// clears the nose and leaves visible air, so the path reads as going around the
// head instead of being painted onto it, then steps in to meet the ear.
// It is ONE curve, speaker to ear, with no straight segment and no join in it.
// Every attempt to build this out of pieces — a straight run plus an arc, or a
// straight run plus a spiral — put a visible corner where the pieces met, even
// when the tangents matched, because the curvature still jumped from zero to
// tight in one step. Sound bending round a head has no corner in it.
//
// A single cubic has no interior joins at all. The two control points do the
// work: the first sits along the line the sound would travel if the head were
// not there (75% of the way to where that ray grazes it), which keeps the early
// part of the path nearly straight and pointed at the listener; the second sits
// out on the standoff ring near the ear, which swings the tail round the head.
//
// The three constants are not taste: they were solved for. A cubic sags between
// its control points, and at the widest speaker angle with the largest head the
// first values tried cut 2.2px INTO the skull. These clear the head across the
// whole of both sliders' range (angle 5-60°, circumference 41-66 cm) — worst
// case touches the surface only at the ear itself, which is where it belongs.
// Changing any of them needs that sweep re-run, not an eyeball at one setting.
