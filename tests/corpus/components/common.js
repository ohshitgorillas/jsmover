// Shared layout primitives: Section (tab body wrapper), Card (the one card
// component — collapsible or not), collapseFrom (the auto/override signal pair
// as a collapse handle), and the checkbox-truth normalizer used across tab
// bodies.
//
// Filed at components/ rather than components/tabs/ because the tabs are not
// its only callers: eight modules outside tabs/ render cards, and reaching up
// into tabs/ for the frame was the single largest violation of the layering
// contract in eslint.config.js.
//
// Card markup lives HERE and nowhere else. Hand-rolled at every call site, a
// surface fix has to be applied at each one and cards.css's .span mask ends up
// enumerating container classes by hand. The
// eslint rule hqptuner/no-hand-rolled-card holds the line; the three sites
// whose structure genuinely does not fit carry a disable comment with a reason.
//
// There is no separate Collapsible. A collapsible card was never a different
// component — it is a card whose head is a button, and keeping the two apart is
// what let their surfaces drift until an open collapsible read as a darker card
// than the card beside it.

// `title` may be a string or markup — a head with a badge or a count needs no

// because that name is already the head content.
//
// `collapse` is the one feature distinction: absent, the card is static and its
// body always renders; present, the head becomes the toggle button and the body
// renders only when open. It carries {open, onToggle} rather than being a bare
// boolean because the flag and the state it needs are the same fact.
//
// `subtitle` is the feature's own prose. It belongs to the CARD and not to a
// row: a card gated by a master switch has one explanation, and rendering it
// under the switch made it read as a caption on the switch. It sits at the top
// of the card BODY and not in the head strip — the head is a name plate, and a
// paragraph inside it turns the strip into a block of raised surface taller than
// the controls it introduces. The text comes from settings.json through
// store/prose.js — a call site passes `noteFor("<gate key>")`, never a string of
// its own.
//
// `center` is for a card whose body is ONE control spanning the whole frame —
// the Output hero row. A head pinned to the left edge of a card that wide reads
// as a caption on whatever happens to sit under its left edge rather than as
// the name of the row beneath it.
// `id` names the card independently of its title, and renders as `data-card`.
// The title is copy — the owner may reword it at any time — so it is the wrong
// thing for anything but a reader to address the card by.
