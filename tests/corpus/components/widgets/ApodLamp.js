// The header's apodizing indicator: a jewel lamp on the chrome row, off unless
// the preference in the System tab's HQPTuner card switches it on.
//
// It is the Engine health strip's reading condensed to one pixel of panel. Both
// take the same scale (lib/apodscale.js), and the lamp spends it on brightness
// where the strip spends it on color: a lamp whose rest state is a painted floor
// is a lamp that is lit whenever the page is up, and an indicator that is always
// on indicates nothing.
//
// On "all" the two agree about the same music by construction. On "uncorrected"
// they part company, and that is the whole point of that mode: the strip keeps
// painting every event, while the lamp reports only what the running filter left
// uncorrected, so a full apodizing filter paints the strip hot and leaves the
// jewel dark. The scale is still shared; the correction is applied after it,
// here, and nowhere else.
//
// What the component publishes is the PEAK for the newest bin TIMES that
// correction, on the --lamp custom property. The decay is CSS's affair (css/base/header.css), and what
// restarts it on every bin is the jewel alternating between two class names that
// name two identical keyframes: a running animation restarts when its NAME
// changes, and nothing else here is allowed to depend on the DOM node being
// replaced.
//
// Keying the jewel on the bin sequence does not work. The template's own whitespace lands as unkeyed text children beside it,
// which puts preact back on matching children by position, so the node is reused
// across a change of key however the key moves — and a reused node never re-runs
// its animation, so the lamp flashes once on mount and sits dark through every
// bin after that. Fast attack and slow release is what an
// incandescent jewel does when its filament heats and cools, and it is also the
// only envelope that reads as a flash rather than a level meter, since ordinary
// playback on an apodizing filter never stops producing events.
