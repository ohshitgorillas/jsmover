// The high-frequency filter's auto-pilot switch.
//
// Not a schema field: it has no lane and no daemon setting behind it, so it follows the
// Auto-save checkbox's shape — its own action, its own copy — rather than store/schema.js.
// It renders in two places, the Output tab's Pre-process card and the LIVE Playback card,
// which is why it is a component rather than markup inlined at either site. The markup is
// the ordinary field row so it sits in a pack beside real fields with no CSS of its own.
//
// The state is read off /api/status, not remembered here: the backend switches auto-pilot
// off by itself the moment the filter is set by hand.
