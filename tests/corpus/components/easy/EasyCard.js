// Easy Mode's card — the whole feature's frame. It stands in place of the three
// cards a user reaches Easy Mode from (Narrow filters, PCM Chain, SDM Chain);
// the swap itself belongs to the pages that render those cards, so this
// component knows nothing about what it replaced.
//
// A real `Card`, not a panel of its own: it sits in the same stack as the cards
// it stands in for, and anything painting the card surface under its own class
// name is how a panel drifts to the wrong border token (docs/design-system.md).
//
// The paragraph under the title says what the mode is and states that only a
// few of HQPlayer's filters are reachable through it, which is Signalyst's
// condition for approving the preset set. So unlike the narrow bar's intro it is
// NOT behind the manual-text pref — it is part of the card, not commentary on
// it. It rides the `subtitle` slot, which is exactly "directly under the title,
// above everything else in the body".
//
// The link after it opens the help panel, which is NOT in the card: six
// paragraphs of guidance here would push the grid off the screen for everyone
// who never asked for them (Help.js).
//
// There is exactly ONE grid container, so a tile has somewhere to land. Which
// page's write lane the tiles use arrives as a prop, because this same card
// renders on the Output tab, where an edit is staged, and on LIVE, where it is
// written straight through.
