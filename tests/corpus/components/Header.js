// Global header: daemon identity + live state, presets dropdown, status pill.
// Outside LIVE, picking a preset does NOT touch the daemon — it previews that
// preset's saved settings into the editor so they can be tweaked first, and the
// pending bar names the previewed preset until Apply commits the switch. Nothing
// conditional renders in this cluster: text that came and went beside the status
// pill shifted every element around it on a routine pick. LIVE has no
// Apply button, so there the pick loads the preset on the spot (pickPreset).
// The active preset comes from config.active (the truly-loaded
// ConfigurationGet name).
