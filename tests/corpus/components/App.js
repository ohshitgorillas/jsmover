// Root: chrome (header + signal path) over the tabs, with the pending bar
// pinned at the bottom. Every child re-renders off the signals store — no props
// threaded through.
//
// LIVE is a mode, not a tab. On, it replaces the tab bar, the tab body and the
// pending bar with the LIVE page: those three are the staged-edit workflow, and
// LIVE has no staged edits to show. The switch itself lives in the header
// (Header.js), which is the one row present in both modes — so it neither moves
// nor costs vertical space when the tab bar goes away.
//
// METER is the other mode, switched from the header's mini spectrum. It replaces
// the tab bar and the tab body but keeps the pending bar, so a header preset pick
// made in METER still has its Apply on screen.
