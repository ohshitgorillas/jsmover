// API, never touching the staged-diff/Apply flow (no dirty flag, no pending
// count). Grays when volume control is disabled (VolumeRange enabled=0 — fixed
// volume, direct SDM, no active stream).
//
// Rendered as the large knob variant. onLive fires continuously while dragging
// (throttled live writes so playback tracks the knob) and publishes the value to
// `volumeDrag`, which is what the Loudness plot and the Range bar needle read;
// onCommit lands the final value and optimistically adopts it so the next 2 s
// poll doesn't snap the dial back. Double-click resets to a moderate -20 dB (a
// deliberate safe default, not a daemon value, so a reset never jumps to full
// volume).
