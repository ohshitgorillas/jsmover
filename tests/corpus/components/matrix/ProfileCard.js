// Matrix profile card — step 5 of the delivery order (matrix-spec §8), rebuilt

//
// Nothing here reloads the engine. A load is the live 4321 lane and nothing
// else (MatrixSetProfile: instant, playback undisturbed), so it lasts until the
// daemon restarts — HQPlayer's own semantics for the switch. A profile is a
// whole matrix context, `<post_process>` included (readme §1.11.2), so the
// switch installs the profile's plugin chain along with its rows. A save or a delete is a staged <matrix_profile> config edit,
// because hqplayerd registers a saved profile in memory only and never writes
// the element — a profile saved its way is gone at the next daemon start. Save
// and Load are therefore one lane each, and neither is ever refused for
// playback state.
