// "Matrix engine is bypassed" — the note that says the pipelines you are
// editing are not in the signal path.
//
// The Matrix tab let you author a whole EQ profile, stage it, apply it and hear
// nothing, because `matrix_enabled` was BYPASS and no surface said so. Only the
// signal-path diagram on another tab ever read that flag.
//
// It reads the EFFECTIVE value, not the running one: staging ENGAGE in the
// Matrix card clears the note immediately, without an Apply, the same way every
// other derived surface on the tab follows staged edits.
//
// TWO sentences, picked by whether the card's own feature is engaged. "These
// settings have no effect" is a complaint about settings the user is actually
// using; a user who has DAC correction switched off is not using any, and what
// they need to know is that the switch itself is waiting on the engine. The card
// knows what "engaged" means for itself and passes it as `on`; this component
// owns only the matrix half.
//
// WHERE IT GOES, and where it deliberately does not. Everything inside <matrix>
// takes it. The Pipelines card takes it unconditionally — the pipeline rows are
// the matrix, there is no separate switch to be off. The Crossfeed card reads its
// own engagement as `crossfeed_enabled` in the Bauer view and an installed
// structural block in the Structural view (store/xfeed/mode.js) — structural
// crossfeed is sixteen compiled pipeline rows and Bauer crossfeed is a
// post_process plugin, so a bypassed engine runs neither. The Matrix response
// card takes the alternate sentence below and only when its plot has something on
// it: an empty plot has no "below" that could be unapplied, so it stays silent.
// The post_process cards, DAC correction and Loudness, read their own switch:
// <post_process> nests inside <matrix> (hqplayerd-readme.txt §1.11.2) and §1.11's
// `enabled` is the matrix processing switch, so a bypassed matrix runs no plugin
// in the chain — the structure documents it, and the note states it.
//
// The Speakers card is out: <speakers> is its own element with its own `enabled`
// (readme §1.9). Level and distance trims keep working with the matrix bypassed,
// so the note there would simply be wrong. The Headphone Auto EQ card is out too:
// it is an importer, and what it imports lands in the Pipelines card, which says
// the sentence already.
//
// The note informs; the graying is the schema's (store/schema.js matrixBypassed,
// on every post_process field). The pipeline TABLE stays editable — a user may
// build a profile against a bypassed engine and engage it afterwards.
