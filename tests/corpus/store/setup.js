// The connection panel's own state: whether it is showing, what discovery
// found, what the user has typed, and what the daemon said after a save.
//
// Two things open the panel. A user opening it from the status pill, and this
// module deciding an install cannot use its daemon. The second reading is taken
// off the health poll and is deliberately not symmetric:
//
//   `credentials_ok` false is a verdict. It is only ever written when the 8088
//   lane has actually answered (lanes/http/forms.py), so there is nothing to
//   wait for and the panel opens on the reading that carries it.
//
//   `reachable` false is not, on its own, evidence of anything: the backend
//   constructs its connection manager unreachable and connects asynchronously,
//   so the first reading of a perfectly healthy install says exactly that. The
//   panel waits GRACE_MS of elapsed browser time before believing it.
//
// The grace is elapsed time rather than a count of polls because the poll's
// cadence is not a constant — store/sync.js reschedules the fast timer off
// `fastPollMs`, 1 s on the volume page, in LIVE and on System with quick
// updates, 2 s otherwise. Counting polls would buy one user twice the grace of
// the next. It is browser time rather than the age of `unreachable_since`,
// which is a server wall-clock stamp: subtracting it here would put two clocks
// in one comparison.
//
// A page that has seen the daemon connected is never auto-opened again. The
// pill and the alert strip already report a daemon that goes away mid-session,
// and a panel thrown over a working page on every dropout would be its own
// fault report.
