// Roon idle-time warning — one fixed-copy alert-strip row.
//
// Roon (song == "Roon" in the Status metadata, the only wire marker it leaves)
// stops and restarts the whole playback engine between tracks whenever the
// engine idle time is at its default of 0 ms. The daemon persists no Roon
// trace anywhere — config XML, /config form, backup archive are all clean —
// so the metadata child during playback is the entire detection surface: no
// latch, no history, the row simply exists while a Roon track is loaded and
// the effective idle_time is still default.
//
// Reads the RUNNING value (`runningValue`, never staged edits or preset
// preview): the engine keeps restarting between tracks until the change is
// actually applied, so the row stays up until then.
