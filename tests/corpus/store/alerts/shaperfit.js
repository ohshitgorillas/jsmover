// The option lists gray a shaper the rate cannot reach (store/ui/options.js
// grayShapersByRate), which closes one direction only: pick the rate first and
// the modulator menu tells you. The other direction — a modulator already
// selected, then the rate dropped under it — is deliberately NOT closed by
// graying rates, because that would lock the user into the higher rate, a worse
// failure than the one it fixes. It is surfaced in words here instead.
//
// The two families differ in kind, not just in degree. An SDM modulator below
// its floor makes the engine produce no output at all, so it is a `crit`; a PCM
// ditherer below its floor still dithers, just not as well as the one the
// manual recommends, so it is a `warn`. That hard/soft split is the product
// decision `data/shapers.json` records as `sdm_modulators` against
// `pcm_dithers` — the manual's own wording is "optimized for" on both sides.
//
// Only the family that will actually produce output raises anything: a PCM-only
// listener carrying a permanent red alert about an SDM chain they never load
// would be noise, not a fault report.
