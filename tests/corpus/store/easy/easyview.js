// Easy Mode's VIEW state: whether the Easy Mode card is on screen instead of the
// filter cards. Nothing here touches a field or the daemon — a tile click is an
// ordinary staged edit, and this module only decides what the user is looking at
// while they make it.
//
// That fact belongs to the BROWSER, not to a preset: which face of the filter
// controls someone prefers is a property of the person, not of the configuration
// they are editing. That is the difference from store/matrix/mode.js, whose
// speakers/headphones choice is stored per preset on the server and only falls
// back to localStorage. Here localStorage is the whole store.
//
// Module load stays node-safe (the SSR harness imports the component graph with
// no localStorage), so every read and write is guarded and a dead store simply
// leaves the in-memory signal driving the session.
