// How much Easy Mode's curated presets cost the machine, in pips. The roster
// and the write tables live in store/easy/easy.js; this module holds the cost
// tables and the one question asked of them, and is pure the same way — no
// signals, no DOM, no network.

// What a preset costs the machine, in pips, per chain. Neither column is a
// filter specification: both rank the presets against each other and say nothing
// about how any filter is designed.
//
// The SDM column ranks each preset's Space filter by GPU power and utilization
// on a playing engine, less the shaper's floor; the two channels agree on the
// ranking. Old School sets the scale at one pip. The column covers the SDM chain
// only and says nothing about PCM.
//
// The PCM column is the owner's ranking, unmeasured, and does not follow the SDM
// one.
//
// Only Damage Control changes family when its material knob moves: its lossless
// positions take the xtr-short filters and its lossy ones the mqa/mp3 family, so
// it is the one preset with a second row. The flagships take the same family in
// both positions and cost the same in both.
