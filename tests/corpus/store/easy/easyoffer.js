// Which Easy Mode presets the grid offers at all, as opposed to which one is
// marked. The curated table and its write sets live in store/easy/easy.js, which is
// deliberately pure — no signals, no engine state; this module is where a
// preset meets what the engine can currently do with it.
//
// Two rules. A tile whose every path leads to a filter that can produce
// nothing is not offered. With the backend pinned to the 44.1 kHz DSD base and
// the output in SDM, a rate-limited filter (ratio class 2x or integer) has no
// path from a 48 kHz-family source, so a preset naming only such filters leads
// nowhere and the grid leaves it out rather than offering a press that cannot
// play.
//
// Derived end to end: which presets qualify falls out of the filters the table
// writes and the ratio classes the running engine states, so the owner moving a
// preset in or out of the table moves it in or out of this set with it.
//
// Positive evidence only, the rule the narrowing this reads from follows: a
// filter whose ratio class nothing states is not limited, and a backend whose
// 48 kHz switch this config surface cannot read (combo) hides nothing.

// or from an Nx source, where it is the field in play. Anywhere else the lever
// has nothing on the other end and the tile does without it.
//
// Withheld rather than offered when the engine has said nothing about the filter
// yet, which is the same "positive evidence only" the rate rule above follows,
// pointed the other way: this rule makes an offer instead of hiding a tile, so
// the absent evidence withholds the offer.
//
// A hidden knob still counts in the write. `writeSet` reads `knobsShown`, so the
// position the user last left it at continues to fill its field — the tile stops
// offering the choice, it does not forget the one already made.
//
// The two rules part company on what the tile does about it. `whenHires` turns
// on the source, which changes under the user without them touching anything, so
// a knob that comes and goes with the track is simply absent. A `when` turns on a
// SIBLING KNOB ON THE SAME TILE: the user moved that sibling, and a control that
// vanishes under their own hand reads as a bug rather than as a consequence. So a
// `when`-unmet knob stays on the tile, marked inert, and the sibling that shut it
// is right there to move back.
