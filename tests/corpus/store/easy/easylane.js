// The two pages Easy Mode renders on write differently, and this is where that
// difference stops. The Output tab STAGES an edit into the pending buffer; the
// LIVE page writes it straight through to the engine and never stages
// (store/live/write.js says why). One card renders on both, so the tiles ask for
// a lane and get back the same three things either way: the output mode, the
// filter NAME currently in each of the four fields, and one way to write a name
// into one of them.
//
// Names, not enum ids, because that is the domain the preset table speaks: the
// running engine is the sole authority for ids and ordering, and static data
// joins by name (architecture §2). Resolving a name to the id a lane wants is
// the last thing that happens, against the option list that lane is showing.
