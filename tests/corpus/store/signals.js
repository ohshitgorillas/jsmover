// The store's source signals: the raw polled trees (engine + config, architecture
// §2), the client-side editor state over them, and the small connection-state
// computeds. Every other store module (resolve.js, actions.js, sync.js) sits on
// top of this one, which imports nothing from them — the dependency edge only
// ever runs one way.
//
// The three trees:
//
//   engine  — live runtime (4321 State/enums/status/health): authority for
//             live-lane control values + the per-mode enum lists + reachability
//   config  — GET /config form: authority for http-lane control values +
//             each field's min/max/enum constraints; the persistent-file baseline
//   staged  — server-side pending buffer ({live, http}); the client mirrors it
//
// Live changes are never persisted, so engine and config can disagree for the
// same setting — that divergence is why these are separate trees (architecture §2).
