// Matrix-profile descriptions — the prose the user wrote about a saved profile,
// stored for the install and shared by every browser pointed at it. Keyed by
// profile NAME, the stable join key (architecture §2), because
// `<matrix_profile>` carries only `name` (readme §1.12) and there is nowhere in
// hqplayerd's config for this text to live.
//
// Writes are QUEUED, not optimistic. A star is one click and lands or does not;
// a description is typed, and a PUT per keystroke would be a write storm on the
// LAN and a store rewritten a hundred times per paragraph. So the editor calls
// `queueDescription` as the user types and the queue drains on a short pause —
// or immediately, when the editor calls `flushDescriptions` because focus left,
// the card unmounted, or the tab went to the background. That last part is why
// the flush is public: blur alone loses the paragraph when Preact unmounts the
// card on a tab switch, which is exactly how people leave a page.
//
// A failed write puts the text BACK on the queue rather than reverting the
// signal. What the user typed is the thing being protected here: reverting to
// the server's copy would delete a paragraph in front of them to report that we
// could not save it.
//
// Nothing polls. A tab picks up another tab's edits on reload, like favorites.
// Module load stays node-safe: the hydrate is guarded on `fetch` existing.
