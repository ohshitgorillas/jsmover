// Crossfeed mode: which of the two implementations is installed, the staging
// that swaps between them, and the client-side memory that makes the swap
// lossless.
//
// Filed under store/ rather than lib/: this module owns two signals, reads the
// resolved config through store/resolve.js, and stages edits through
// store/actions.js. A lib module does none of those things, and filing it there
// put three upward edges in the import graph.
//
// What is INSTALLED is derived: a recognized 16-row structural block at rows
// 0..15 is Structural, anything else is Bauer. There is no config field for it
// because the structural controls have no daemon representation at all — they
// exist only as a consequence of the compiled rows, exactly as the compensation
// slider's percentage lives in its own block rather than in config.
//
// What the user is LOOKING AT is stored separately (see the mode section at the
// foot of this file). The two are not the same question, and answering the second
// with the first is what made the segment turn processing on and off by itself.
//
// Switching mode STAGES a change like any other edit — it deletes nothing. The
// installed block sits in the baseline until Apply, and Discard puts it back.
//
// The remembered triple exists for a narrower reason: the baseline holds the
// block as last APPLIED, so a user who nudges the angle, toggles to Bauer and
// toggles back would silently lose that nudge if we recompiled from the baseline.
// An in-memory signal covers the session; localStorage carries it across an Apply
// or a reload (prefs.js precedent). That last part is a convenience, and its cost
// is worth stating: those values are browser-local and do not travel with the
// configuration.
