// The LIVE view's store: what its controls read, and the one path they write by.

// This module owns the lane's own mutable state — which control is mid-write,
// what the last error on each control was, and the rules that say which writes
// invalidate what. It is separate because both the write path and every reader
// depend on it, and nothing here depends on them: it is the bottom of the lane.

// whose options come from an enumeration is unsafe for that whole window: its
// list is the pre-write one, and the IDs in it stop meaning what they meant the
// moment the engine re-enumerates. Disabling them is the surfacing — an in-row
// text note would reflow the row for the seconds a mode write takes.

// A live error is about one write and the connection that write died on. The
// engine goes down briefly under SetFilter and SetMode, and the poll loop brings
// a new connection up within seconds (manager._connect_and_load) — at which point
// the message describes a moment that is over, and the control it sits on is
// working again. So it goes when the connection does.
//
// Keyed on the connection's own timestamp, not on `reachable`: the drop can be
// shorter than the health poll's interval, so the false that a reachable-edge
// would need is never observed and the error would sit there forever.
// The FIRST connection is not a reconnect: nothing on the page predates it, so
// there is nothing of an older connection's to drop. Only a move from one
// connection to another clears.
