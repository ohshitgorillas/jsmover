// The assembled view model — the one thing components/live/View.js reads. Its own
// module because it is the top of the lane: it names every part and nothing names
// it, so keeping it apart is what stops the parts reaching sideways for each
// other.
//
// This module does NOT import ./state.js, and that has one consequence worth
// knowing before you write a new consumer. state.js registers a load-time effect
// that clears liveErrors when the daemon reconnects; before this file was split
// out of store/live.js, importing ANY live-lane name registered that effect,
// because there was only one module. Now a consumer that takes liveModel alone
// would never load state.js, and stale per-field errors would survive a
// reconnect. Both current entry points are safe — live/View.js also takes
// liveBusy/liveErrors/writeLive, and store/live/presets.js takes
// remirrorLive/reportError — so nothing is wrong today. A future reader-only
// consumer must import from ./state.js as well.
