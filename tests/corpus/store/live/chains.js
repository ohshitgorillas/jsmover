// Filter narrowing is the same feature the Resampling tab has, on the same
// state: one set of facets narrows a control here and its twin there, because
// they are the same control and the narrowing is the user's standing answer to
// "which of these 77 filters am I willing to look at". Presentational only — a
// running value the facets exclude drops off its own dropdown and stays selected
// and named on the closed control (`valueLabel`), the same as on the tab.
// Shapers carry `narrow` nowhere and are left whole.
//
// Rate graying is the other half of the same story, and the same feature the
// tabs have (components/widgets/Field.js): a modulator whose floor is above the selected
// SDM rate is grayed with that floor as the reason. It is driven off the same
// schema `rateGray` field the tabs read, so the two views share one rule rather
// than growing two — and it is what closes the modulator-first order into a
// rate/shaper conflict. The rate-first order is not closed by graying rates,
// which would lock the user into the higher rate; it is reported in words
// (store/alerts/shaperfit.js). A selected option below the floor grays but stays
// listed and stays selected — grayShapersByRate marks, it never drops.
