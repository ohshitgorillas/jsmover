// The one path the LIVE view's controls write by.
//
// Every control writes the moment it changes — one field, one
// POST /api/config/live, readback-verified by the backend before it answers.
// Nothing here stages. The pending buffer belongs to the tabs view and Apply
// flushes all of it, so a LIVE control that touched it would apply edits the
// user never asked for (lanes/live/lane.py says the same from the other side).
//
// Two mirrors follow a write. `engineState` always: a live edit never reaches the
// config file, so /api/state is the only place its new value shows up. `enums`
// when the write re-enumerates — SetMode swaps the filter and shaper lists
// wholesale, and the rate list depends on both mode and the selected filter
// (manual §4.6). The backend has already refreshed them; this pulls the fresh
// lists into the page so the next control resolves against what the engine now
// offers.
//
// No control here is ever refused because playback is running (CLAUDE.md): what
// a live change costs mid-stream is the user's to spend, and the captions say so.
