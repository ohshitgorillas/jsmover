// A live snapshot is not a config preset. The header's presets are whole

// handful of enum IDs handed to POST /api/config/live, which writes the running
// engine and never touches the configuration file. Nothing here stages, and
// nothing here is saved past the daemon's next restart — the record on disk is
// HQPTuner's, the settings it carries are the engine's and are as temporary as
// anything else on the LIVE page.
//
// The store is small and changes only when this card changes it, so it is not on
// the poll: it is read when LIVE opens and re-read after each save or delete.
