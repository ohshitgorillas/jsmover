// Per-track apodizing-event history — the data behind the Engine Health card's
// density strip. The daemon reports `apod` as a cumulative counter, so the
// strip's shape comes from per-poll increases: one bin per distinct Status frame
// while PLAYING, cleared when the track changes. Distinct is the operative word
// — a frame repeating the last one is a poll that outran the daemon, not an
// interval, and see accumulate() for what recording it did to the strip.
//
// A bin carries the poll cadence in force when it was appended rather than a
// timestamp. The daemon's own clock cannot stand in: `position` is seconds of
// elapsed playback, so it says nothing about a paused or restarted poll, and a
// wall clock in the store would be the only one in the module graph. Cadence per
// bin is enough — a window of W seconds is the newest run of bins whose recorded
// cadences sum to no more than W — and it degrades honestly, since a page that
// polls slower simply records coarser bins.
//
// Visibility is stateful, not a threshold on the current reading: the strip
// appears on the first event of a track and stays up for as long as playback
// continues, so a burst in an opening section does not vanish from the card the
// moment the burst ends. It comes back down only when playback stops, or when a
// track ends having produced no events at all.
//
// "Ends" is the track change itself, not a remaining-time reading. The daemon's
// `remain_min` / `remain_sec` are `length - position`, and `length` is 0 on any
// stream that does not carry one, so on a Roon source they report negative
// elapsed time and never reach zero.
//
// Nor is the track change always a change of `track_serial` — see isNewTrack()
// for the two shapes it takes and how each was measured.

// and neither ever runs backwards inside one track. So a reading that went
// backwards is a track boundary the serial did not report.
