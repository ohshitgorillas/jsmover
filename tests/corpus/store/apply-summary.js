// Apply-report summarization: turns the backend's apply report into the
// {ok, text} pair the apply pill and the pending bar both render.
//
// Pure — it reads no signal and imports nothing from the store — which is why it
// can sit outside the three-tree modules with no risk of an import cycle and no
// signal crossing a file boundary. store/actions.js imports `summarize`; the
// rest stays private to this module.

// `count` is the number of staged edits captured before apply — the http/matrix
// lanes each collapse many field edits into a single POST, so counting reports
// ("2 staged" -> "Applied 1 change") undercounts the real changes.
/**
 * @typedef {object} Verdict
 *   What the apply pill and the pending bar render. `text` is the sentence the
 *   reader gets and is the owner's to reword; `code` names WHICH outcome this
 *   is, and the fields beside it carry the parts the sentence interpolates. An
 *   apply has two axes — what the apply itself did, and how its preset save went
 *   — so `save` rides alongside `code` rather than replacing it.
 *   `lastApply` is annotated with this type rather than left to inference:
 *   `signal(null)` alone infers `any`, and a caller reading a field name that
 *   does not exist would then type-check clean. That annotation names a bare
 *   `value` property rather than a signal type, because the vendored signals
 *   typings export no `Signal` name and `.value` is the whole of what callers
 *   touch.
