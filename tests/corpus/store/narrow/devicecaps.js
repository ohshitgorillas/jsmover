// Output-device capability narrowing. The daemon announces what the device it
// opened accepts, HQPTuner reads that out of the log (engine/devicecaps.py) and
// serves it on /api/config as `device_caps`; this module turns it into grayed
// menu entries. Nothing here ever hides an option or blocks a write — it grays,
// with the reason, exactly like the rest of the store's narrowing.
//
// The governing rule, everywhere below: when the capability cannot speak for the
// control, it narrows NOTHING. No announcement, a staged device the daemon has
// not opened yet, the combo backend (two devices, one announcement, unknown
// which limits bind) — all fall through to the full menu. Graying on a guess
// makes a reachable setting unreachable, which is the worse failure.
