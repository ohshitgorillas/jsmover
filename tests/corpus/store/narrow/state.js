// Client-side filter narrowing — HQPTuner's own feature (no daemon field): the

// by facet. Purely presentational: it never changes a staged value, only what
// the dropdown offers. The current selection gets no exemption: it lists only
// when it passes the facets, so what the menu shows is exactly the batch the
// facets describe. Nothing is lost by that — dismissing the dropdown without
// picking a row leaves the selection where it was, and the closed control still
// names it (components/controls/Combobox.js `valueLabel`).

// the output mode is SDM and the device exposes no 48 kHz-family DSD rate,
// rate-limited filters cannot produce output from 48 kHz-family sources, so
// "auto" hides them (match.js resolves it against the live rates enum).
