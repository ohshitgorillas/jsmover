//
// There is no exception in here, deliberately: a focused control is guarded
// exactly like an unfocused one. Exempting the focused control is what let a
// clicked slider take the wheel and move. The control is also NOT blurred —
// blurring a number box mid-type fires its change handler and commits a
// half-typed figure.
//
// Attach as onWheel on every wheel-sensitive control: range, number, select.

// so preventDefault takes effect — unlike a document-level listener, which the
// browser makes passive by default.)

// wheelGuard's blind spot, closed: a scroll gesture over a slider on WebKit
// does not arrive as a cancelable wheel at all. Measured on Safari 26.5, the
// wheel events it does send are non-cancelable and the value change rides a
// separate channel — for the ARIA slider role, TRUSTED ArrowLeft/ArrowRight
// keydowns aimed at the element without focusing it (Knob.js onKeyDown carries
// that case); for a native range, an `input` that simply appears, with the
// guard above never firing. Neither can be prevented, so a slider edit is
// honored only with explicit user provenance on that element:
//
//   held  — a pointer is down on it (drag, track-click). Cleared by pointerup /
//           pointercancel, and by any pointermove reporting no buttons: a
//           context menu opened mid-drag eats the pointerup, and without the
//           buttons check the browser's stuck native drag would keep editing.
//   armed — one-shot: a slider keystroke on it WHILE IT HOLDS FOCUS, or a drag
//           release. Keyboard edits arrive with no pointer held, and a native
//           range fires its committing `change` AFTER pointerup — both need
//           their edit pair honored. Consumed by the `change` that closes the
//           pair. The focus qualifier is what keeps WebKit's scroll-synthesized
//           arrow key from arming a control the user never touched.
//
// The wheel-injected edit has neither and is refused. Trackers live on
// document capture so they observe every gesture before any handler; the
// typeof guard keeps this module importable in the SSR test harness, where the
// suite installs its fake document before importing.
