// Physical path parameters for the structural crossfeed compiler
// (docs/crossfeed-math.md). This module owns the Brown & Duda geometry alone —
// the head-shadow alpha, the Woodworth ray delay, the lp1 corner, and the
// PathParams bundle derived from the two physical controls. It is its own module
// because it is pure physics with no imports at all: row synthesis, frequency
// response and recognition all sit on top of it and none of them sit under it.
//
// The model is Brown & Duda's structural HRTF (IEEE TSAP 6(5), 1998), whose
// head-shadow filter is a single-pole/single-zero that factors EXACTLY into a
// constant plus a scaled first-order lowpass:
//
//   H_HS = (1 + jαx)/(1 + jx) = α + (1−α)/(1 + jx),   x = ω/(2ω₀),  ω₀ = c/a

 *   groupDelayNear: number, groupDelayFar: number }} PathParams

// c is the paper's value, NOT HQPlayer's 343.956. That default belongs to the
// delay plugin's `v` argument, which converts `d=<metres>` into a delay — we emit
// `t=<seconds>`, so `v` is never consulted and there is nothing to match. The
// paper's 343 is the constant a, alpha_min and theta_min were fitted against on
// KEMAR data, and those travel together. The difference is 0.7 us of ITD, under
// the 22.7 us sample floor at 44.1 kHz and dominated ~37x by head-radius spread
// across adults (+/-26 us) — which is why `a` is a control and c is not.
// m/s — Brown & Duda §II.A, per the note above. Deliberately a constant, not a compileRows/recognizeRows parameter: a mismatch between the two recovers a silently wrong head radius (0.08673 m for a compiled 0.0875 m) rather than declining the block.
