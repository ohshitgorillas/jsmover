// Installation-side surface of the structural crossfeed block: the settings it
// cannot coexist with, what it carries in from the rows it replaces, and the
// named control points offered for it.
// binaural.js holds the maths, this file the install surface,
// and callers import from whichever they need.
//
// Like binaural.js, this module imports NOTHING — that is what lets the
// binaural tests run under plain node with no shim.

// --- invariants --------------------------------------------------------------
// Two settings elsewhere in the app are incompatible with this block, and both
// are reachable today by a user doing something otherwise reasonable. Neither is
// a matter of taste, so neither is left to the user to get right:
//
//   post_bauer_enabled — the matrix runs BEFORE post-process, so bauer on top of
//     this block is two crossfeeds in series.
//   matrix_iir2fir = 2 — converts the matrix's parametric stages to linear phase,
//     and linear phase means constant group delay, which deletes the low-frequency
//     ITD the head-shadow filter supplies (docs/crossfeed-math.md §3). The
//     magnitude response stays correct, so nothing on a plot would show it.
//
// iir2fir = 1 is ALLOWED. The manual calls it "direct conversion, retain
// minimum-phase", and minimum phase preserves group delay for a given magnitude —
// which is exactly why T_g falls out of eq. (3) rather than being added on top.
// The conversion applies to parametric EQs, so `delay` stages are untouched.
//
// This reports; it does not mutate. The caller stages the fixes so they appear in
// the pending bar like any other change — the app never silently rewrites config
// the user can see, and a conflict arriving via a preset load (whose snapshot
// carries post_bauer_enabled) has to be visible for the same reason.

// destroys settings the user already had, which is not honouring their action
// but doing something they never asked for. Refusing costs them a click;
// installing over the top costs them their tuning.
//
// Readable means a plain stereo pair: two rows, each routed from a source to
// its own matching mixdown, with a gain the block can carry as a preamp. Ears
// come off the SOURCE channel, never off row position. Gains marked dB carry as
// they stand; gains marked Lin convert, which is undefined at or below zero.
// Rows past the pair ride along untouched, so none of them may write into a
// mixdown the block owns.
